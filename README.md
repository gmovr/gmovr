### ðŸ‘‹ My name is Even Tobiesen
Iâ€™m Evan Tobiesen. I lead software projects at Automattic, focusing on growth, hiring, and MarTech for WordPress.com.

Iâ€™m into home automation, building cool stuff (in code or otherwise), cars, and finding excuses to travel. Originally from Norway, Iâ€™ve lived in exile near Barcelona with my wife for over a decade.

I enjoy writing code in most languages, with varying levels of proficiency, from PHP to Python, TS and Go.
